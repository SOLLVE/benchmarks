This is a part of the repository of the ECP OpenMP performance benchmark suite, used for a benchmark-style (smaller than mini-App style) performance experimentation based on applications with the most time consuming computation kernels having the Computational Pattern of Monte Carlo Methods.

The benchmark is primarily representative of Applications of important to the United States Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Project(ECP), in particular Autodock.

The performance experimentation we are focused on is of OpenMP 5.0 features and performance optimization based on them, and is driven the ECP's Software Technology project on developing LLVM's OpenMP, otherwise known as SOLLVE (https://www.bnl.gov/compsci/projects/SOLLVE/).
